Cool AI stuff for large value payments

## Config
Std config file included however a local_config file is attempted to be imported. 
config file therefor serves as a review and not a valid config.


## Running the experiment
Experiment code should be in the top level directory. Models in the model directory and data(base) related code in the data directory. This will keep the experimentation files as clean as possible.
The mainfile is intended to be a simple file here running that file will produce a rerun of experiments.
Command line arguments in combination with the mainfile allow for custimization.
